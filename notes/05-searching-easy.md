## 1. Sqrt(x)

**Problem**:  
Given a non-negative integer `x`, return the **integer part** of its square root (i.e., `âŒŠâˆšxâŒ‹`).  
You must not use built-in exponentiation functions like `pow()` or `x ** 0.5`.

---

**Approach**: Binary Search on Square Domain

- Search space: `start = 0`, `end = x`
- For each `mid`, compute `midÂ²` and compare with `x`
  - If `midÂ² == x` â†’ return `mid`
  - If `midÂ² < x` â†’ store `mid` as potential answer and move right
  - If `midÂ² > x` â†’ move left
- Final answer is the largest `mid` such that `midÂ² â‰¤ x`

---

**Complexity**:

- **Time**: O(log x) â€“ binary search
- **Space**: O(1) â€“ constant space

---

**Example**:

```text
Input: x = 8

Search space: [0, 8]
â†’ mid = 4 â†’ 16 > 8 â†’ move left
â†’ mid = 2 â†’ 4 < 8 â†’ store 2, move right
â†’ mid = 3 â†’ 9 > 8 â†’ move left

Final answer: 2
```

---

**Key Takeaway**:

- This is a classic **binary search on monotonic function**.
- Efficiently avoids floating-point math.
- Handles large inputs safely using `long` for squaring.

---

**Pattern**:

- Binary search over numeric domain
- Monotonic function evaluation
- Integer approximation

---

**Edge Cases**:

- `x = 0` â†’ return 0
- `x = 1` â†’ return 1
- Large `x` â†’ avoid overflow by casting `mid * mid` to `long`

## 2. Guess Number Higher or Lower

**Problem**:  
You're playing a number guessing game. The number is picked from `1` to `n`, and you must find it using a pre-defined API:

```java
int guess(int num)
```

which returns:

- `0` â†’ correct guess
- `-1` â†’ guess is too high
- `1` â†’ guess is too low

Your task is to **find the picked number** using **as few guesses as possible**.

---

**Approach**: Binary Search with Feedback API

- Initialize `start = 1`, `end = n`
- While `start â‰¤ end`:
  - Compute `mid = start + (end - start) / 2`
  - Call `guess(mid)`:
    - If result is `0` â†’ return `mid`
    - If result is `-1` â†’ move left â†’ `end = mid - 1`
    - If result is `1` â†’ move right â†’ `start = mid + 1`

---

**Complexity**:

- **Time**: O(log n) â€“ binary search
- **Space**: O(1) â€“ constant space

---

**Example**:

```text
Input: n = 10, pick = 6

â†’ mid = 5 â†’ guess = 1 â†’ move right
â†’ mid = 8 â†’ guess = -1 â†’ move left
â†’ mid = 6 â†’ guess = 0 â†’ found

Output: 6
```

---

**Key Takeaway**:

- This is a classic **binary search with feedback loop**.
- Efficiently narrows down the search space using API hints.
- Common in interactive problems and system design simulations.

---

**Pattern**:

- Binary search
- Feedback-driven narrowing
- Midpoint probing

---

**Edge Cases**:

- `n = 1` â†’ only one guess needed
- `pick = n` â†’ search goes all the way to the end
- `pick = 1` â†’ search ends early

## 3. First Bad Version

**Problem**:  
You're given `n` product versions `[1, 2, ..., n]`.  
One version fails the quality check, and **all versions after it are also bad**.  
Using the API `isBadVersion(version)`, find the **first bad version** with **minimal API calls**.

---

**Approach**: Binary Search for Transition Point

- Initialize `start = 1`, `end = n`
- While `start < end`:
  - Compute `mid = start + (end - start) / 2`
  - If `isBadVersion(mid)` is `true` â†’ move left â†’ `end = mid`
  - Else â†’ move right â†’ `start = mid + 1`
- Loop ends when `start == end`, which is the **first bad version**

---

**Complexity**:

- **Time**: O(log n) â€“ binary search
- **Space**: O(1) â€“ constant space
- **API calls**: minimized to log-scale

---

**Example**:

```text
Input: n = 5, bad = 4

â†’ mid = 3 â†’ isBadVersion(3) = false â†’ move right
â†’ mid = 4 â†’ isBadVersion(4) = true â†’ move left
â†’ start == end == 4 â†’ return 4

Output: 4
```

---

**Key Takeaway**:

- This is a classic **binary search on monotonic boolean function**.
- Efficiently finds the transition point from `false` to `true`.
- Optimized for minimal API usage â€” no redundant checks.

---

**Pattern**:

- Binary search
- Transition detection
- API-driven narrowing

---

**Edge Cases**:

- `n = 1` â†’ only one version â†’ return 1 if bad
- `bad = n` â†’ search goes all the way to the end
- `bad = 1` â†’ search ends early

## 4. Two Sum II â€“ Input Array Is Sorted

**Problem**:  
Given a **1-indexed**, sorted array `numbers`, find two distinct elements that add up to a given `target`.  
Return their indices as `[index1, index2]` (1-based).  
You must use **constant extra space**.

---

**Approach**: Two-Pointer Scan

- Initialize two pointers:
  - `start = 0` (beginning of array)
  - `end = n - 1` (end of array)
- While `start < end`:
  - Compute `sum = numbers[start] + numbers[end]`
  - If `sum == target` â†’ return `[start + 1, end + 1]`
  - If `sum > target` â†’ move `end--` to reduce sum
  - If `sum < target` â†’ move `start++` to increase sum

---

**Complexity**:

- **Time**: O(n) â€“ single pass
- **Space**: O(1) â€“ constant space

---

**Example**:

```text
Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6

â†’ start = 0, end = 2 â†’ sum = 2 + 4 = 6 â†’ match

Output: [1,3]
```

---

**Key Takeaway**:

- This is a classic **two-pointer pattern** for sorted arrays.
- Efficiently finds the pair without extra space or hash maps.
- Guaranteed to find a solution due to problem constraints.

---

**Pattern**:

- Two-pointer traversal
- Sorted array optimization
- Sum comparison logic

---

**Edge Cases**:

- Negative numbers â†’ handled naturally
- Duplicates â†’ not reused due to `start < end`
- Only one valid pair â†’ loop exits early

## 5. Valid Perfect Square

**Problem**:  
Given a positive integer `num`, return `true` if it is a **perfect square**, else return `false`.  
You must not use built-in functions like `sqrt()` or exponentiation.

---

**Approach**: Binary Search on Square Domain

- Search space: `start = 1`, `end = num`
- For each `mid`, compute `midÂ²` using `long` to avoid overflow
  - If `midÂ² == num` â†’ return `true`
  - If `midÂ² > num` â†’ move left â†’ `end = mid - 1`
  - If `midÂ² < num` â†’ move right â†’ `start = mid + 1`
- If loop ends without match â†’ return `false`

---

**Complexity**:

- **Time**: O(log num) â€“ binary search
- **Space**: O(1) â€“ constant space

---

**Example**:

```text
Input: num = 8

â†’ mid = 4 â†’ 16 > 8 â†’ move left
â†’ mid = 2 â†’ 4 < 8 â†’ move right
â†’ mid = 3 â†’ 9 > 8 â†’ move left

Loop ends â†’ no match â†’ return false
```

---

**Key Takeaway**:

- This is a classic **binary search on monotonic function**.
- Efficiently checks for perfect squares without floating-point math.
- Using `long` for squaring avoids overflow for large inputs.

---

**Pattern**:

- Binary search
- Integer approximation
- Overflow-safe arithmetic

---

**Edge Cases**:

- `num = 1` â†’ return true
- `num = 0` â†’ not allowed (positive integers only)
- Large `num` â†’ safely handled via `long` casting

## 6. Arranging Coins

**Problem**:  
Given `n` coins, build a staircase with `k` rows such that the `i-th` row has exactly `i` coins.  
Return the number of **complete rows** that can be formed.  
The last row may be incomplete.

---

**Approach**: Binary Search on Triangular Sum

- Each complete row `i` requires `i` coins â†’ total coins for `k` rows = `k(k+1)/2`
- Use binary search to find the **maximum `k`** such that:
  - `k(k+1)/2 â‰¤ n`
- If `mid` rows require more coins than `n`, move left
- If valid, store `mid` and move right to try for more rows

---

**Complexity**:

- **Time**: O(log n) â€“ binary search
- **Space**: O(1) â€“ constant space

---

**Example**:

```text
Input: n = 8

Search space: [1, 8]
â†’ mid = 4 â†’ 4Ã—5/2 = 10 > 8 â†’ move left
â†’ mid = 2 â†’ 2Ã—3/2 = 3 < 8 â†’ move right
â†’ mid = 3 â†’ 3Ã—4/2 = 6 â‰¤ 8 â†’ move right

Final answer: 3
```

---

**Key Takeaway**:

- This is a classic **binary search on monotonic math function**.
- Efficiently finds the largest `k` such that `k(k+1)/2 â‰¤ n`.
- Avoids brute-force iteration and handles large `n` safely using `long`.

---

**Pattern**:

- Binary search over numeric domain
- Triangular number evaluation
- Integer approximation

---

**Edge Cases**:

- `n = 0` â†’ return 0
- `n = 1` â†’ return 1
- Large `n` â†’ safely handled via `long` casting
