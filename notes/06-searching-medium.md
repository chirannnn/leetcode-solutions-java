## 1. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array

**Problem**:  
Given a sorted array `nums`, find the **starting and ending index** of a given `target`.  
If the target is not found, return `[-1, -1]`.  
You must solve it in **O(log n)** time.

---

**Approach**: Dual Binary Search

- Perform **two binary searches**:
  1. First to find the **leftmost (first) index** of `target`
  2. Second to find the **rightmost (last) index** of `target`
- Modify the binary search condition:
  - If `target == nums[mid]`, store `mid` as potential answer
    - If searching for first index â†’ move `end = mid - 1`
    - If searching for last index â†’ move `start = mid + 1`

---

**Complexity**:

- **Time**: O(log n) â€“ two binary searches
- **Space**: O(1) â€“ constant space

---

**Example**:

```text
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8

First search (find first index):
â†’ mid = 2 â†’ nums[2] = 7 < 8 â†’ start = 3
â†’ mid = 4 â†’ nums[4] = 8 â†’ ans = 4, end = 3
â†’ mid = 3 â†’ nums[3] = 8 â†’ ans = 3, end = 2

Second search (find last index):
â†’ mid = 4 â†’ nums[4] = 8 â†’ ans = 4, start = 5

Output: [3,4]
```

**Key Takeaway**:

- This is a classic **boundary search** problem.
- Requires careful control of binary search direction.
- Efficiently finds both ends of a target range.

---

**Pattern**:

- Binary search variant
- Left/right boundary detection
- Conditional narrowing

---

**Edge Cases**:

- Target not found â†’ return `[-1, -1]`
- Empty array â†’ return `[-1, -1]`
- All elements are target â†’ return `[0, n-1]`
