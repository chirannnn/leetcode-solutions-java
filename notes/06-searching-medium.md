## 1. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array

**Problem**:  
Given a sorted array `nums`, find the **starting and ending index** of a given `target`.  
If the target is not found, return `[-1, -1]`.  
You must solve it in **O(log n)** time.

---

**Approach**: Dual Binary Search

- Perform **two binary searches**:
  1. First to find the **leftmost (first) index** of `target`
  2. Second to find the **rightmost (last) index** of `target`
- Modify the binary search condition:
  - If `target == nums[mid]`, store `mid` as potential answer
    - If searching for first index â†’ move `end = mid - 1`
    - If searching for last index â†’ move `start = mid + 1`

---

**Complexity**:

- **Time**: O(log n) â€“ two binary searches
- **Space**: O(1) â€“ constant space

---

**Example**:

```text
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8

First search (find first index):
â†’ mid = 2 â†’ nums[2] = 7 < 8 â†’ start = 3
â†’ mid = 4 â†’ nums[4] = 8 â†’ ans = 4, end = 3
â†’ mid = 3 â†’ nums[3] = 8 â†’ ans = 3, end = 2

Second search (find last index):
â†’ mid = 4 â†’ nums[4] = 8 â†’ ans = 4, start = 5

Output: [3,4]
```

---

**Key Takeaway**:

- This is a classic **boundary search** problem.
- Requires careful control of binary search direction.
- Efficiently finds both ends of a target range.

---

**Pattern**:

- Binary search variant
- Left/right boundary detection
- Conditional narrowing

---

**Edge Cases**:

- Target not found â†’ return `[-1, -1]`
- Empty array â†’ return `[-1, -1]`
- All elements are target â†’ return `[0, n-1]`

## 2. Single Element in a Sorted Array

**Problem**:  
Given a sorted array where every element appears **exactly twice**, except for **one element** that appears **only once**, return that single element.  
Must run in **O(log n)** time and **O(1)** space.

---

**Approach**: Binary Search with Pair Indexing

- Every pair starts at an **even index**: `[0,1], [2,3], [4,5]...`
- Use binary search to find the **first index where this pairing breaks**
- At each `mid`:
  - If `mid` is even and `nums[mid] == nums[mid + 1]` â†’ pairing is valid â†’ move right
  - If `mid` is odd and `nums[mid] == nums[mid - 1]` â†’ pairing is valid â†’ move right
  - Else â†’ pairing breaks â†’ move left
- Loop ends when `start == end` â†’ single element found

---

**Complexity**:

- **Time**: O(log n) â€“ binary search
- **Space**: O(1) â€“ constant space

---

**Example**:

```text
Input: nums = [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]

â†’ mid = 4 â†’ nums[4] = 3 == nums[3] â†’ valid pair â†’ move right
â†’ mid = 6 â†’ nums[6] = 4 == nums[7] â†’ valid pair â†’ move right
â†’ mid = 7 â†’ nums[7] = 8 == nums[8] â†’ valid pair â†’ move right
â†’ mid = 8 â†’ end reached â†’ single element is nums[2] = 2

Output: 2
```

---

**Key Takeaway**:

- This is a **binary search on index parity**.
- Efficiently skips over pairs to isolate the unpaired element.
- Works only because the array is sorted and all other elements appear exactly twice.

---

**Pattern**:

- Binary search
- Pair validation via index parity
- Unpaired element detection

---

**Edge Cases**:

- Single element at start or end â†’ handled naturally
- Array length is odd â†’ always one unique element
- No duplicates â†’ not valid input per constraints
