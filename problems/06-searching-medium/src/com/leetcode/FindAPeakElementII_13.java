/*
A peak element in a 2D grid is an element that is strictly greater than all of its adjacent neighbors to the left, right, top, and bottom.

Given a 0-indexed m x n matrix mat where no two adjacent cells are equal, find any peak element mat[i][j] and return the length 2 array [i,j].

You may assume that the entire matrix is surrounded by an outer perimeter with the value -1 in each cell.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(m log(n)) or O(n log(m)) time.

Example 1:
Input: mat = [[1,4],[3,2]]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Both 3 and 4 are peak elements so [1,0] and [0,1] are both acceptable answers.

Example 2:
Input: mat = [[10,20,15],[21,30,14],[7,16,32]]
Output: [1,1]
Explanation: Both 30 and 32 are peak elements so [1,1] and [2,2] are both acceptable answers.

        Approach: Binary Search on Columns (Optimal: O(m * log n))

        Story / Intuition:
        -----------------
        Imagine you are in a 2D matrix where each cell has a number. A "peak" is a cell that is
        bigger than its neighbors (up, down, left, right). Instead of checking every cell,
        we can use a smart "divide-and-conquer" strategy.

        Step 1: Pick the middle column.
        Step 2: Find the maximum element in this column (we only care about this column for now).
        Step 3: Compare this max with its left and right neighbors.
            - If it is bigger than both neighbors, it's a peak! âœ…
            - If the left neighbor is bigger, move search to left half.
            - If the right neighbor is bigger, move search to right half.
        Step 4: Repeat until we find a peak.

        Why this works:
        ----------------
        - There are no equal adjacent cells.
        - There is always at least one peak in the matrix.
        - Moving toward the larger neighbor guarantees we move toward a peak.
